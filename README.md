### Iris Dataset Summary

## Origin and purpose of the dataset

British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in 1936 developed this data set. The development was done to demonstrate analysis based on classification into predifined categories.
His goal was to show that multiple measurements could be used to differentiate between flower specicies.

The data set itself was desgined to show statistical analysis, specially around discriminant analysis.

## Describing the contents of the dataset

1. Species - The species of the flower. This is categorical data type
2. Sepal Length - Sepal helps protects the flower and is the outer part of the flower. This variable takes the sepal length in centimeters. It is of floating data type.
3. Sepeal Width -Sepal helps protects the flower and is the outer part of the flower. This variable takes the sepal width in centimeters. It is of floating data type.
4. Petal Length - Petal is the colorful innerpart of the flower. This variable takes the petal length in centimeters. It is of floating data type.
5. Petal Width  - Petal is the colorful innerpart of the flower. This variable takes the petal lwidth in centimeters. It is of floating data type.



## Relevant background information

- The data set itself was collected by Edgar Andreson.
- The data set has a limitation in its size, the sample size is relatively small and hence may contain biasness towards something.
- The data set is freely available on multiple platforms including python website and uci machine learning repositorty
